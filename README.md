# Caeser-cipher-cracker

This JS function will show you all 26 versions of the string you pass it with each different shift.
While it was originally ment for decrypting, it may also be used to encrypt.
Unfortunately, it will automatically change to lowercase.
I would appreciate contributions, thank you.
